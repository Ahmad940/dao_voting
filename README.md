cd dao_voting
```

yarn
```

### Build The program [optional]
```bash

# this will download crates, compile and build the rust anchor program if not build and run the tests
anchor test 
```

### Deploying The contract
```bash
# deploy the contact
anchor deploy 
```

# Porgram stucture
The anchor program is broken into modules for cleaner code and easy readability approach
```md
Anchor program
â”œâ”€â”€ src
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ instructions
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ states
â”œâ”€â”€ lib.rs

â””â”€â”€ // ...etc
```
### instruction module

This abstract away the contract accounts instructions

### state module

This abstract away the contract accounts states
